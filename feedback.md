# Feedback for Kris

Great job on this assignment, Kris! You really seem to have grasped the material. Since you covered all of base mode, my feedback might seem a little nit-picky - next time, try a few of the stretch goals! I think you may surprise yourself on how much you can accomplish.

### Base Mode

| Complete? |                                                 Features                                                 |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    yes    | Use `axios` to retrieve (`GET`) data from to `/gallery` and store it in `App.js`.                        |
|    yes    | Create a new **component** for the `GalleryList`.                                                        |
|    yes    | Create a new **component** called `GalleryItem.js` and pass it the individual gallery items via `props`. |
|  partial  | Display all of the images on the screen.                                                                 |
|    yes    | Swap the image with the description on click.                                                            |
|    yes    | Display the number likes for each item and include a like button.                                        |           
|    yes    | When the like button is clicked, use `Axios` to update (`PUT`) the like count `/gallery/like/:id`.       |
|    yes    | Update the gallery each time a like button is clicked.                                                   |

- You have a head for naming conventions; great job! Each component is titled with a name that is clear and consise. For your css, you also named your classes quite well. I noticed that you have some ```class="MyClass"``` and some ```class="My-class"```. It is best practice to use one and remain consistent throughout your code.
- You will note that I gave you partial credit for displaying all of the image on the screen - you have nine images saved in the images folder
and only seven in gallary.data.js. It looks like you originally had an image there and removed it later (I can tell because your id's start at 2!). If this
happens again, don't forget to go retrace your steps, remove images, and update your images.
- I love that you commented what each function does - keep that up!
- The colors that you chose worked well with you app. I would challenge you to push yourself further with the UI - how can you make this a little more visually pleasing for your user?

Keep it up, Kris! I'm looking forward to seeing what you do next.
